# Bowie_State_Cybersecurity-REU
I did my research in machine learning and how it approach to enhancing the intrusion detection systems.
# What is this?
This is my REU project I did for Bowie State University and I did my research in machine learning and how it approach to enhancing the intrusion detection systems.

# What is an REU?
Research Experiences for Undergraduates are competitive summer research programs in the United States for undergraduates studying science, engineering, or mathematics. The programs are sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and are hosted in various universities.

# How competitive was this program? 
REU programs are highly competitive. This program in particular recieved over 100 student and accpeted only 15. They are normally research positions that are fully-funded, which last 6-10 weeks during the summer.
